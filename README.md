I want to make simple application through which you are going to interact with website through voice to fill forms.

Why I am building this:
I am not really sure whether it solves any problem or makes humans easier or less active. As of now I just want to work on different aspects of AI.
I currently worked on mostly on text based llms, but not really worked on voice models. So, I want to kind of explore voice part using with llms by building an application.
